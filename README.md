### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm cyberpunkcoder!
I'm working as a Backend Engineer in the bay area, California. If you are interested in any of my projects feel free to shoot me an email or such! I'm a big proponent of Golang and I'm excited to discover what the future holds! You'll find that my most recent projects are written in Go!

Some current big projects are [my website](https://www.cyberpunkcoder.com), and my little space game called [Reaction Control](https://www.github.com/cyberpunkcoder/reaction-control).

Older (but complete) projects include a [modular golang discord bot](https://www.github.com/cyberpunkcoder/gobot), also [a nice script](https://www.github.com/cyberpunkcoder/golang-pixel-installer) to automatically install the latest version of golang (and optionally pixel game engine) and a Raspberry PI based vending machine framework written in Java called [spoolr](https://www.github.com/cyberpunkcoder/spoolr).
