### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm cyberpunkcoder!
I'm working as a freelance software engineer in the bay area, California, but I'm looking for a more permanent full-time  or part-time job. If you are interested in hiring me I would love to speak with you! I've started working with Golang this year and I'm very interested in what the future holds for this exciting new language. You'll find that my most recent projects are most likely written in Go!

Some current big projects are my website https://www.cyberpunkcoder.com, and my little space game called Reaction Control. https://www.github.com/cyberpunkcoder/reaction-control

Older (but complete) projects include a modular golang discord bot https://www.github.com/cyberpunkcoder/gobot, a script to automatically install the latest version of golang (and optionally pixel game engine) https://www.github.com/cyberpunkcoder/golang-pixel-installer and a raspberry pi based vending machine framework written in Java https://www.github.com/cyberpunkcoder/spoolr
